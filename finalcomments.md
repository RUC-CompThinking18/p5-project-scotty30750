# Interactivity
You managed to build in a few ways to interact with your project in a short amount of time. Being able to draw on the flag and switch colors was enough for this project, but the starting and stopping of the national anthemm was a nice extra touch.

# Code Quality
Your code generally does what it needs to do, and you used P5's resources really well, especially in getting audio working, which isn't something we covered in class. I'm not sure the project was totally working as you intended(on my machine it was drawing no matter if the mouse was pressed or not), and some additional comments would have been nice. But, overall, you did a lot in little time.

# Aesthetics
For this short project, you did all you needed to: create a kind of toy that can live in a web browser. Good work.
